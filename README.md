```


## First task
Along with instructions is contained in task1.php inside this directory

# SWapi demo

## Given task

Using the Star Wars API: http://swapi.dev,
extend it with new endpoints and add in a form of some API client for below:

- Show all films where involved a given character acts
- Show all planets created after 12/04/2014
- Show people starships which have above 84000 passengers in total
- Showing all information of a Films model in as endpoint and then on FRONTEND display it in table using HTML/CSS 
  and some JS component (jQuery, VueJS, React or Angular). Be free to use some cool 3rd party library for Table component.

EXECUTION:
You are free to use some 3rd party packages and be creative on your own.

Also, keep in mind these points your application to have:
- Do some API docs or POSTMAN JSON collection share
- Make it (the code) look pretty: extensible, readable â€¦
- Make sure your API Client has filtering and search options included as in API Docs stated

BONUS POINTS:
Want to impress us a bit more? Here are some tips to do so:
- Dockerize it
- Make some unit tests by TDD Framework of your choice


## Task solution
For the purpose of this task, no authentication/authorization has been implemented.

The following application extends the http://swapi.dev with a few extra endpoints

### ENDPOINTS

#### Films endpoint
```php
/** Returns all films. */
/api/films

/** 
 * Returns films filterable by character string.
 * Throws an validation error if character name not specific enough. 
 */
/api/films?filter[character]=luke skywalker

/** 
 * Returns the film resource with ID with resolved relationships 
 */
/api/films/:id
```

#### Planets endpoint
```php
/** Returns all planets. */
/api/planets
/** Returns all planets filterable by date created. */
/api/planets?filter[created]=12/04/2014
```

#### Starships endpoint
```php
/** Returns all starships. */
/api/starships
/** Returns all starships filterable by minimal number of passengers. */
/api/starships?filter[passengers]=84000
```

### SwApiClient class

```php
// initialize
$client = new SwApiClient(app()->make(\Illuminate\Http\Client\Factory::class)); 

// set endpoint with (optional) query parameters
$client->endpoint('planets', ['search' => 'Dathomir']);

// or use some of the aliases (which accept query params), same as above method

$client->planets();
// films alias accepts
$client->films();
$client->starships();
$client->people();

// Filter and search parameters for endpoint
$client ->searchFor('a') ->filterPage(3)->endpoint('planets')->getResults();
```

All methods are chainable and have to end with one of the following client methods.
- each method receives optional url string as a parameter.
- if the url parameter is provided, the client directly queries that url instead of building the endpoint.

```php
get(string $fullUrl = null) // returns results with metadata
getResults(string $fullUrl = null) // returns results only (without metadata)
getResponse(string $fullUrl = null) // returns response object
```

The following method is used to get all the resources from a paginated endpoint,
looping through each paged url.
Callback can be provided to filter each paged result.
```php
getAllResults(callable $callback = null)

// for example, get all the starships from API
$client->starships()->getAllResults();
```
